## Overview
This project is a simple web application that allows users to interact with a dynamic, animated circle. The circle's size, color, border, and speed can be modified using a set of control buttons.

- **Border Toggle**: Toggle the border color of the circle.
- **Color Input**: Set custom colors for both the circle's background and border.
- **Animation**: Start, stop, and control the speed of the circle's animation.
- **Time Tracking**: Displays the start time, end time, and the total duration of the animation.

## Technologies Used
